## About

The Private Retrieval Cell supports research & development of private communication systems.

The options available today for interactive (low latency) communication with privacy guarantees are very limited. Solutions developed to date have focused on the traditional web model of a single trusted origin publisher for data (as opposed to content-addressed systems where data may be replicated in advance), and have drawbacks both in their incurred latency and threat model.

This organization is structured to explore and develop viable mechanisms for reader-private communications under the hypothesis that it is possible to design scalable systems that don't sacrifice latency for privacy.

A full description of the thesis can be found [here](https://github.com/protocol/research-grants/blob/master/RFPs/rfp-014-private-retrieval-of-data.md).

The Cell is supported by [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/) and others.
